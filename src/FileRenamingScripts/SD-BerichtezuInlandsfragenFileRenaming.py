# Author: Christopher Thomas Goodwin
# Creation Date: 2023.11.08
# Summary: Renames all SD-Berichte zu Inlandsfragen files
# from the NSHWE De Gruyter database.
# All files originally named from downloading files and the OS adding a number to prevent duplicates
# Uses Beautiful Soup to get HTML text
# Then renames according to patter "date Part # - SD-Berichte zu Inlandsfragen.html"
# Date format: YYYY.MM.DD
#
# All HTML file's first text line is of example: "SD-Berichte zu Inlandsfragen vom DD. Month YYYY (Series designation)"
# The script isolates that line, removes white space, captures the date after "vom",
# captures the month after the "." that comes after the date day, then grabs the year at the end but before series designation
# It then uses that as the basis for creating the final file name.
# However, since multiple files have the same date but are actually different,
# a dictionary stores and counts the dates and
