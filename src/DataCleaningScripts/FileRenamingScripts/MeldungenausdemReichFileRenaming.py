# Author: Christopher Thomas Goodwin
# Creation Date: 2023.11.01
# Summary: Renames all Meldungen aus dem Reich files
# from the NSHWE De Gruyter database.
# All files named in pattern: numberInSeries.html
# Uses Beautiful Soup to get HTML text
# Then renames according to patter "date - Meldungen aus dem Reich.html"
# Date format: YYYY.MM.DD
#
# All HTML file's first text line is of example: "Bericht zur innenpolitischen Lage (Nr. 8) 25. Oktober 1939"
# The script isolates that line, removes white space, captures the date after the ")" character,
# captures the month after the "." that comes after the date day, then grabs the year at the end.
# It then uses that as the basis for creating the final file name.
#
# Notable exceptions in database: Out of about 350 files, about 5 have the pattern "(Nr. #) vom DD Month YYYY"
# These don't fit the pattern of the script and were manually altered
# as it made more sense than to alter the script to account for something of such low frequency.
